## Logging

Zarathustra supports a command to log messages during execution in the interpreter.

The values of expressions can be checked and basic string interpolation is supported:

```zarathustra
{{#include ../../../zarathustra_cli/examples/book/logging.zara}}
```

By default, logs get removed during compilation. In order to include them in the compiled program, the `--debug` flag has to be enabled.
